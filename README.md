# React + TypeScript + Vite

A modern single-page React application built with Vite and TypeScript.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v20 or higher)
- npm (v10 or higher)

### Installation

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Available Scripts

### Development

Start the development server with hot module replacement (HMR):

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server at `http://localhost:5173/`

### Build

Build the application for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

The build output will be in the `dist/` directory. This command runs TypeScript compilation followed by Vite's production build.

### Preview

Preview the production build locally:

```bash
npm run preview
```

This serves the built application from the `dist/` directory for testing before deployment.

### Lint

Run ESLint to check code quality:

```bash
npm run lint
```
