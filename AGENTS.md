## Review guidelines
- When asked "review for acceptance criteria", respond using EXACTLY ONE of:
  - PASS: `Ok`
  - FAIL: 
    ```
    Unmet:
    - <criterion line 1>
    - <criterion line 2>
    ```
- Do not include emojis, salutations, or extra commentary. Extra text = non-compliant and should be treated as FAIL.
